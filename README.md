Process OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for Kolkata (India) and investigate this dataset

I have downloaded the OSM data for the Kolkata (India) metro area from:
https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/your-extracts/bfc06038eae9

This XML file is then audited sanity, wrangled to make corrections as much as possible 
and then a SQL database is created out of it. Various queries are made on the database
to extract properties and plotted for easy visualization.
